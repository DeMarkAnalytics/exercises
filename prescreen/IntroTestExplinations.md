1. **How would you manage communication between different microfrontends in an application?**
   This question investigates the candidate's understanding of inter-microfrontend communication and their experience with events, shared global state, or other patterns for coordinating behavior across different parts of the application.

1. **What would be your strategy for handling shared dependencies in a microfrontend environment?**
   This question assesses the candidate's knowledge about dependency management in a microfrontend architecture, including potential strategies for avoiding dependency version conflicts and reducing the overall size of the application.

1. **How would you approach testing in a microfrontend architecture, given that individual microfrontends might be developed and deployed independently?**
   This question tests the candidate's experience with testing in a microfrontend environment, including unit testing, integration testing, end-to-end testing, and potentially contract testing. The candidate should understand how to ensure that the overall application remains functional even when individual microfrontends are changed.

   1. **Can you explain how Kubernetes' declarative model works for managing services and how it differs from the imperative model?**
   This question helps to assess the candidate's understanding of Kubernetes' declarative approach for managing application state, including the roles of the Kubernetes API, etcd, and the various controller processes.

1. **What is Helm and how does it interact with Kubernetes to manage deployments?**
   This question assesses the candidate's understanding of Helm as a package manager for Kubernetes, and its role in simplifying the deployment and management of applications.

1. **Can you describe a situation where you've used Helm charts to manage a complex application deployment on Kubernetes? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?**
   This question allows the candidate to demonstrate their practical experience with Helm and Kubernetes, including dealing with issues of chart complexity, dependencies, and version management.

1. **How would you manage secrets and sensitive data in a Kubernetes environment?**
   This question tests the candidate's knowledge of Kubernetes' mechanisms for managing sensitive data, such as Secret and ConfigMap objects, and their understanding of security best practices.

1. **How would you monitor and troubleshoot issues in a Kubernetes environment? What tools would you use?**
