This is an application for a pizza shop to manage its orders.

We need to make the "Submit order" button work.

This is a list of things that need to happen when the user presses "Submit order".

1. "Order not submitted" needs to change to a timestamp.
2. The "submit order" button needs to disappear.
3. The remove ingredient buttons need to disappear.
4. The "Number of completed orders" needs to update to reflect the correct number.

After making the sumit order button work, please look at `src/components/Order.js`. What are some ways in which this component could be improved?

Also look at the reducer function in `src/store/orders.js`. Do you see any problems with this reducer function?
